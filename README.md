# THIS CODE IS UNFINISHED  

# What is LumenOS
LumenOS is the project that I have decided to remake for the 3rd time now for the sake of making the code more readable and organised as my skills with python have increased. This new version is the one in which I plan to work on long-term.

# How does this differ to the other versions?
The other versions of LumenOS that I have made (as cool as they may be considering my skill level at the time) are going to be nothing compared to this one. This is because I plan to make this one of the best projects that I can make with my skill level to improve what I could make back then, such as:  
• Version 1 - 2000 lines, one 70kb python file, perpetual loop of if and elif statements and no functions because I didn't know that functions can't see variables from the main program unless they are globals or given to the program.  
• Version 2 - 100 lines, I barely even started it and lost motivation. However at that time I had more knowledge on modules such as tkinter and rich.  
• Version 3 (This repo) - Still in development but I hope it turns out way better since I have learnt modules such as importlib and I have learnt how to use string features such as .split(), which will let me allow arguments to be inputted in the same line as the command and not as inputs inside the function  

# The Goals
• Impress my computing teacher  
• Get more familiar with using multiple Python files for one project  
• I want more green squares on my github profile
